# Color Tester
My story with Color Tester was [love at first tweet](https://twitter.com/boton/status/1127882113821368322).

The original illustrator version didn't meet my needs, so I decided to do a web version. 
This way I could use it right from the browser and also improve some CSS skills that I had almost forgotten.

Enjoy!
